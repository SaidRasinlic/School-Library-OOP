# School-Library-OOP

In this project I will create School Library app where you can: add new students or teachers, add new books, save records of who borrowed a given book and when. I will use UML class diagram and create entities presented by it. While I'm building this Ruby application I will be able to understand more deeply Object-Oriented Programming, Unit Tests (RSpec) and the "Decorator" design pattern.
